# plat -- Chip16 platform game engine

Experiments in writing platform game code for Chip16.

You need a C compiler, as16 and img16 to compile.

The latter two are available on my Github; search for img16 and chip16.

___

To use, compile:
`make`

then run:
`mash16 plat.c16`

Button A to jump, Left and Right to move.
